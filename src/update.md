# Updating

This guide is intended to facilitate upgrading to the next minor or major
version of Rand. Note that updating to the next patch version (e.g. 0.5.1 to
0.5.2) should never require code changes.

This guide gives a few more details than the [changelog], in particular giving
guidance on how to use new features and migrate away from old ones.
